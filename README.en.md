# Real-time Vehicle Entry-Exit Counting using YOLOv11 + ByteTrack  
> A real-time vehicle detection and tracking system using YOLOv11 for object detection and ByteTrack for robust object tracking. Designed to count vehicles crossing defined IN/OUT lines within a specified polygonal ROI. Ideal for parking lots, IoT systems, and edge devices.

This system leverages object detection and tracking techniques to count vehicles passing through designated IN/OUT lines inside a polygonal region of interest (ROI), using either live camera feeds or video files. It maintains accurate Track IDs even under partial occlusion and supports real-time overlay of key metrics such as IN count, OUT count, and FPS on the output video.

## Project Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ count_vehicle.py        # Main script for vehicle counting
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ get_frame.py            # Extract a video frame to define ROI on Roboflow PolygonZone
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ videos/                 # Input videos
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ weights/                # YOLOv11 model files (.pt)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/                # Processed video and image outputs

## üéØ Key Features

- Detects vehicles (cars, pickups, etc.) using YOLOv11
- Tracks moving vehicles using ByteTrack with consistent track IDs even with occlusion
- Focuses detection within a user-defined polygon region (ROI)
- Counts only vehicles that actually **pass through** the IN/OUT lines
- Displays real-time overlay with IN / OUT / FPS info on screen

## System in Action

The GIF below demonstrates how the system detects and counts vehicles as they move through the defined IN/OUT lines within a polygonal ROI.

## How to Use

1. Place your video in the `videos/` folder
2. Place your YOLOv11 model (`yolo11x.pt`) in the `weights/` folder  
   If not found, it will be automatically downloaded at runtime
3. Edit these lines in `count_vehicle.py` to match your file names:

```python
video_name = "parking.mp4"
model_name = "yolo11x.pt"
```

> üîó Download demo video: [parking.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SHUg4CTJOr1VHGALDlz6n41lb7jXkLBc/view?usp=sharing)

4. Run the script:

```bash
python count_vehicle.py
```

5. Press `q` to stop. The processed video will be saved to the `outputs/` folder.

## Polygon ROI and IN/OUT Line Definition

Use `get_frame.py` to extract a video frame and define the polygon ROI using the tool at [https://polygonzone.roboflow.com](https://polygonzone.roboflow.com)

```bash
python get_frame.py  # Extracts frame 100 (changeable inside the script)
```

The saved image will be located at `outputs/frame_100.jpg`

## Requirements

```
numpy
torch
opencv-python
ultralytics
supervision
```

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
